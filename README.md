It is a smart contract project written in [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/) using [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/).
- It a smart contract I developed leveraging Foundry.
- It is a CLAMM - Concentrated Liquidity Automated Market Maker Decentralized Engine similar to [Uniswap v3](https://blog.uniswap.org/uniswap-v3), but with some less additional functionalities.
- Following properties are ommited when compared to the Uniswap v3 engine.
  -   Factory
  -   Price oracle
  -   Protocol fee
  -   Flash swap
  -   NFT
  -   Solidity advanced math libraries
  -   Callbacks
  



## Getting Started

 - [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git): You'll know you did it right if you can run `git --version` and you see a response like `git version x.x.x`
 - [foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/): You'll know you did it right if you can run `forge --version` and you see a response like `forge 0.2.0 (816e00b 2023-03-16T00:05:26.396218Z)`
 - [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html) (optional - either you can install `make` or you can simply substitute the make commands with forge commands by referring to the Makefile after including your .env file): You'll know you did it right if you can run `make --version` and you will see a response like `GNU Make 3.81...`
